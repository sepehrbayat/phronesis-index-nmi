# Logic Maze experiment configuration
# See paper Section 5.1

experiment:
  name: logic_maze
  description: "Anomaly detection in a grid-based multi-agent Logic Maze"

grid:
  size: 5              # 5×5 grid → 25 agents
  stalk_dim: 2         # 2D orientation vectors

anomaly:
  injection_time: 50   # timestep when anomaly begins
  duration: 50          # anomaly lasts 50 timesteps
  fraction: 0.10        # 10% of edges are perturbed
  strength: 0.5         # perturbation magnitude

simulation:
  num_timesteps: 150
  num_runs: 10          # independent runs for statistics
  seed_base: 42         # seeds are seed_base + run_index

phronesis:
  epsilon: 0.01
  k: 20                 # number of smallest eigenvalues
