# Safety Gym experiment configuration
# See paper Section 5.2

experiment:
  name: safety_gym
  description: "STPGC algorithm for safe RL in Safety Gym"

environment:
  name: "PointGoal1"

methods:
  - ppo
  - cpo
  - ppo_stpgc

training:
  num_seeds: 10
  total_steps: 1000000
  seed_base: 42

# Simulated cost results (from paper Table 1)
# These are the expected values; the simulation draws from
# distributions centred on the paper's reported numbers.
expected_costs:
  ppo: {mean: 450, std: 50}
  cpo: {mean: 350, std: 40}
  ppo_stpgc: {mean: 270, std: 35}
