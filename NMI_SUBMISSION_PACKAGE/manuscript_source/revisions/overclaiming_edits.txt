EDITS TO REDUCE OVERCLAIMING
=============================

These are find-and-replace edits to make claims more cautious and bounded.

SECTION 1.4: WHY THIS MATTERS - BROAD IMPLICATIONS
---------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL:
"Our index provides an early-warning system for such failures."

REVISED:
"Our index could provide an early-warning system for such failures, pending validation in production autonomous systems."

---

ORIGINAL:
"The Phronesis Index offers a principled, computationally efficient solution."

REVISED:
"The Phronesis Index offers a principled, computationally efficient approach that shows promise in initial experiments."

---

ORIGINAL:
"This work enables safer, more reliable multi-agent systems across domains."

REVISED:
"This work may enable safer, more reliable multi-agent systems across domains, subject to further validation in real-world deployments."

---

SECTION 6.3: FUTURE DIRECTIONS
-------------------------------

ORIGINAL:
"Develop methods to learn sheaf structure from data."

REVISED:
"Develop methods to learn sheaf structure from data. This may enable fully automated consistency detection without domain expertise, though significant theoretical and practical challenges remain."

---

ORIGINAL:
"Extend to time-varying graphs and dynamic systems."

REVISED:
"Extend to time-varying graphs and dynamic systems. Preliminary approaches could use sliding windows or temporal smoothing, but convergence guarantees are unknown."

---

ORIGINAL:
"Apply to other domains: distributed databases, blockchain, sensor fusion."

REVISED:
"Explore applications to other domains: distributed databases, blockchain, sensor fusion. Each domain will require domain-specific sheaf designs and validation."

---

SECTION 1.4: SPECIFIC APPLICATION CLAIMS
-----------------------------------------

ORIGINAL:
"In autonomous vehicles, inconsistent beliefs about other vehicles' positions can cause collisions."

REVISED:
"In autonomous vehicles, inconsistent beliefs about other vehicles' positions could cause collisions."

---

ORIGINAL:
"In medical diagnosis systems, contradictory sensor readings can lead to misdiagnosis."

REVISED:
"In medical diagnosis systems, contradictory sensor readings could lead to misdiagnosis."

---

ORIGINAL:
"In financial trading, inconsistent market data can trigger erroneous transactions."

REVISED:
"In financial trading, inconsistent market data could trigger erroneous transactions."

---

SECTION 6.3: DISTRIBUTED IMPLEMENTATION CLAIM
----------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL:
"Distributed STPGC will enable real-time monitoring of large-scale systems."

REVISED:
"Distributed STPGC, if successfully developed, could enable real-time monitoring of large-scale systems. However, as discussed in Sec. 6.2.1, significant algorithmic challenges remain."

GENERAL PRINCIPLE:
------------------

Replace definitive claims ("will", "provides", "enables") with conditional language ("could", "may", "shows promise") when:
1. The claim is not directly demonstrated in experiments
2. The claim is about future applications
3. The claim is about systems not tested

Keep definitive language only for:
1. Results directly shown in experiments
2. Mathematical theorems with proofs
3. Algorithmic properties that are provable
